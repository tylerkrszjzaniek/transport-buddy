### Transport Buddy v 0.8 ###

###### Hello and welcome to Transport Buddy! This is my third independent project and my first using Bootstrap

#### About

You can access the site in its current state [here!](https://summit-transport-buddy.netlify.com/)

Transport Buddy is a website, which I would eventually like to refactor into a mobile app. I created this site with the intention of helping employees with daily tasks at my current job, Summit Transport.

My job involves wheelchair transportation, which involves precise scheduling, accurate directions, and knowledge of operations. Currently, we use several different apps together, as we have struggled to find one that meets all of our needs at once.
This site attempts to merge the functionality of several apps together into one cohesive site.

#### Features
  + Simple timesheet using localStorage to store user data (currently non-functional)
  + Google Map integration with modular list of frequently visited locations
  + Transportation pricing Calculator
  + Tutorials and Checklists


##### Current issues:
  + timesheet feature not working properly
  + pricing calculator displays incorrectly if user does not enter mileage before selecting checkbox operations
  + overly complex code in timesheets.js
  + potential issues re: large images in tutorial assets
  + minor mobile styling issues
  + pricing calculator lacks options for discounts
